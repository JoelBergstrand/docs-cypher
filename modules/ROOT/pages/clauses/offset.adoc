`OFFSET` defines from which row to start including the rows in the output.


By using `OFFSET`, the result set will get trimmed from the top.
Please note that no guarantees are made on the order of the result unless the query specifies the `ORDER BY` clause.
`OFFSET` accepts any expression that evaluates to a positive integer and does not refer to nodes or relationships.

`OFFSET` is synonymous to `SKIP`. For details, see xref:clauses/skip.adoc[SKIP].
